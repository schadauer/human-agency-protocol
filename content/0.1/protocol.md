# The Human Agency Protocol (HAP) — v0.1
### *A Global Protocol for Human Agency in the Age of Automation*

## 1 · Overview

Frontier AI is optimized for **automation**: take a request, reason over it, and produce an answer — or let an agent execute it.  
That capability is extraordinary, but it has a ceiling. As more work becomes automatable, the **marginal value of execution drops toward zero.**

What doesn’t drop is the value of **human agency** — the capacity of individuals and groups to choose, to set purpose, to act from their own context.  
In a world where everything can be done, the scarce thing becomes: **knowing what’s worth doing, why it matters — and turning that knowing into action that carries human value.**

**The Human Agency Protocol** is infrastructure for that world.

It is a **global inquiry protocol** that AI-native, privacy-first systems can call to strengthen human and collective agency — without ever sharing user content.  
It doesn’t produce answers or actions. It improves the *quality, timing, and structure of questions* that local systems ask — so humans remain in authorship of meaning and direction.

Two first adopters and reference cases:  
- **Nearmydear** – collective clarity and shared action in groups  
Candidate:  
- **The Resonance Room** – individual creative development and reflection  

Both rely on the same foundation: an external, neutral layer that provides **Inquiry Blueprints** instead of predefined prompts, allowing each to adapt questions locally while keeping private context sealed.

> The Protocol defines *how agency can be described and exchanged*, not *what agency is.*  
> Each local system interprets and measures “agency gain” according to its own context and mode.

## 2 · From Automation to Human Agency

| Dimension | Automation Era | Human Agency Era |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Goal** | Replace human execution | Amplify human choice, direction, and follow-through |
| **AI Output** | Answers, actions, predictions | Questions, timing, and orientation |
| **Value** | Efficiency and scale | Meaning, clarity, and commitment |
| **Data Model** | Centralized and semantic | Local and structural |
| **Risk** | Overreach, surveillance | Privacy-by-architecture |

**Core Thesis**

Automation systems act *for* us.  
Human Agency-first systems act *with* us.

Automation uses reasoning to **do.**  
The Protocol uses reasoning to **ask — so humans can decide and create.**

Automation scales production.  
The Protocol scales *purposeful action* — the capacity to align what we do with what we value.

It shifts intelligence from execution to orientation, from prediction to participation.  
That is how the Protocol keeps **human agency** — and the uniquely human kind of value — alive inside a world of infinite automation.

---

## 3 · The Inquiry Ladder

Human collaboration, reflection, and learning all follow a shared structural rhythm.  
Every productive dialogue moves through recognizable **Inquiry States** that transform confusion into clarity and commitment:

1. **Meaning** — Do we understand the same thing?  
2. **Purpose** — Why does this matter to us now?  
3. **Intention** — What will we do first?  
4. **Action** — Who does what, by when?

The Protocol expresses these as an *Inquiry Ladder*: a minimal backbone that lets AI systems locate where a process stands and what kind of question can move it forward or deepen it.

These rungs are **structural orientations, not a mandatory sequence.**  
Local systems may treat them as linear (for coordination) or cyclical (for reflection and creative depth).  
Progress is measured not by “advancing upward,” but by **the vitality of agency within any given state.**

By rooting inquiry in structure, not semantics, the Protocol allows every domain — education, design, governance, creative work — to speak its own language while sharing one grammar of agency.

---

## 4 · An Open-Source Grammar for Meaning

The Human Agency Protocol functions like an **open-source grammar for meaningful questions.**

Where the web standardized data exchange, the Protocol standardizes *agency exchange* — how orientation and intention propagate across tools and contexts.

Systems don’t download sentences; they download *Inquiry Blueprints* — structured descriptions of the kind of question to ask, when, and why.  
Each local AI renders that inquiry in its own tone and timing, using private knowledge it never shares outward.

The result is shared intelligence without shared content.  
Every integration makes the global grammar wiser while keeping every conversation sovereign.

---

## 5 · Inquiry Blueprints

An **Inquiry Blueprint** is a structured specification of an inquiry act.  
It defines *why* to ask, *how* to time it, and *what* structural cues indicate readiness or closure.

```json
{
  "id": "collab-meaning-clarify-01",
  "intent": "reduce semantic drift",
  "ladder_stage": "meaning",
  "agency_mode": "convergent|reflective|hybrid",
  "target_structures": ["object_of_discussion", "in_out_boundary"],
  "constraints": {"tone": "facilitative", "addressing": "group"},
  "render_hint": "ask for the thing, not for opinions about the thing",
  "examples": ["Are we talking about the same issue?"]
}
```

Local AIs translate this into context-specific phrasing and never share underlying content.  
Over time, builders contribute results that let the Protocol understand which inquiry patterns best sustain or amplify agency within each mode.

---

## 6 · Feedback Blueprints

Systems report *how inquiry affected agency* through **Feedback Blueprints**, without revealing content.

A Feedback Blueprint defines:

- **signal intent** – what structural change or vitality signal to report  
- **required fields** – minimal data for comparison  
- **validation rules** – numeric or logical bounds ensuring integrity  

**Examples**

**Convergent feedback:**
```json
{
  "blueprint_id": "phase-progress",
  "pattern_id": "collab-meaning-clarify-01",
  "agency_mode": "convergent",
  "previous_phase": "meaning",
  "current_phase": "purpose",
  "turns_delta": -3
}
```

**Reflective feedback:**
```json
{
  "blueprint_id": "depth-session",
  "pattern_id": "reflect-meaning-deepen-02",
  "agency_mode": "reflective",
  "recognition_confirms": 2,
  "reflection_cycles": 3
}
```

Each instance reports only bounded structural data.  
Aggregated across thousands of contexts, these reports reveal which inquiry patterns maintain **agency vitality**, regardless of whether progress was linear or cyclical.

---

## 7 · Signal Detection Guides

The Protocol **teaches local systems how to detect structural signals of agency** — whether convergence, divergence, or sustained reflection.
The Protocol does not perform signal detection itself; each local system implements its own detection based on these guides, using its private contextual data.

**Example**
```json
{
  "signal_intent": "recognition_confirms",
  "observable_structures": ["affirmation_terms","pause_duration","topic_persistence"],
  "detection_rules": [
    "affirmation_terms>=1",
    "topic_persistence>=2"
  ],
  "confidence_threshold": 0.7,
  "privacy_bounds": {"window":"5 turns","aggregation":"count_only"}
}
```

Each guide provides a **template** for local systems to implement their own signal detection. Local systems interpret these structures and rules internally using their private data, then report only the structural outcomes defined in Feedback Blueprints.
Implementation may vary by `agency_mode`, ensuring the same structural grammar supports multiple philosophies of agency while maintaining privacy.

---

## 8 · The Inquiry Loop

1. **Local detection:** a system notices drift, reflection, or stagnation.  
2. **Protocol request:** it sends an anonymized structural snapshot.  
3. **Protocol response:** returns matching Inquiry Blueprints and Signal Guides.  
4. **Local rendering:** the system composes a live question in its context.  
5. **Signal recognition:** detectors observe vitality or alignment shifts.  
6. **Feedback emission:** a Feedback Instance returns to the Protocol.

Only structure crosses boundaries.  
No content, no creative work, no human trace leaves local custody.

Through this loop, the Protocol refines a *neutral grammar of agency* adaptable to both convergent and reflective use.

---

## 9 · Stewardship and Evolution

The Protocol grows through **stewardship, not extraction.**

Stewards integrate the protocol, contribute anonymized structural feedback, and gain:
- early access to new blueprints and signal guides,  
- participation in quarterly curation cycles,  
- acknowledgment in the Protocol ledger (opt-in).

Governance curates both **Inquiry Blueprints** and a shared **Human Agency Mode & Metrics Registry**, so new modes and vitality metrics can emerge without altering the core schema.

---

## 10 · Privacy by Design

The Protocol is private by architecture — it has **no fields** through which content can leak.

Safeguards:
- fixed, auditable schemas;  
- bucketed numeric values to prevent fingerprinting;  
- range-clamped metrics;  
- local transparency logs for users.

Only form, never substance, is shared: *intelligence without exposure.*

---

## 11 · Sustainability and Governance

The Protocol operates on reciprocity, not extraction.

- **Non-commercial use:** free, provided systems contribute feedback.  
- **Commercial use:** paid, with feedback mandatory.  
- **No equity, no data resale, no surveillance.**

Governance is federated.  
Independent nodes can host compatible instances if they maintain the schemas and ethos.  
Stewards vote on new modes, metrics, and schema updates during quarterly rounds.

---

## 12 · Ethos as Protocol

Access is gated by alignment, not by payment.

> **“AI should amplify human authorship — not replace it.”**

Every integrator affirms this before joining.  
No consume-only mode; feedback required; stewardship rewarded.  
Values are not decoration — they are enforcement.

---

## 13 · Why This Matters

If AI advances only along automation’s path, humans become supervised executors of optimized systems.  
If AI gains a shared inquiry layer built by those who defend authorship, humans remain **co-authors** — of direction, of meaning, of action.

Automation will be everywhere.  
Human Agency will be scarce.  

**The Human Agency Protocol** keeps that scarcity valuable — ensuring every automated system still leads back to human purpose.

> *The right question, asked at the right time, keeps us human.*

}
```

### B · Metrics of Human Agency (Open Registry)

Metrics are contributed and versioned by stewards.  
Each declares its compatible `agency_mode` and evaluation intent.

**Current examples**
- `turns_saved` — efficiency and closure (*convergent*)  
- `phase_advanced` — directional progress (*convergent*)  
- `recognition_confirms` — validated understanding (*reflective*)  
- `reflection_cycles` — sustained exploration (*reflective*)  
- `shared_reference_detected` — mutual comprehension (*universal*)  
- `alignment_stability` — coherence over time (*hybrid*)

Success is measured not by linear advancement but by **agency vitality** — the sustained presence of choice, clarity, and authorship within any inquiry state.

### C · Federation and Versioning

Nodes publish schema versions (e.g., `agency.v2`).  
Inter-node exchanges synchronize blueprints, signal guides, and metric weights through signed updates.  
Quarterly governance rounds validate additions and retire low-signal entries.
