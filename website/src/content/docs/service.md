A **HAP Service Provider** is the connective layer of the Human Agency Protocol ecosystem. It enables human-first applications to access shared inquiry infrastructure—**without exposing private data or rebuilding the foundation themselves.**

Rather than managing user interactions directly, a service provider manages **the structure of interaction**—how systems ask, reflect, and align around meaning and purpose. It translates the open Human Agency Protocol into real, usable APIs and ensures every inquiry or feedback loop follows strict rules of **privacy, transparency, and authorship integrity.**

Service Providers act as **technical stewards** for the protocol. They maintain the infrastructure, validate blueprints, and handle feedback signals while ensuring no personal or semantic data ever leaves local custody. Each provider operates independently but under a shared commitment: keep human agency measurable, protected, and sovereign inside every AI interaction.

## What Service Providers Do

| Role                       | Description                                                                                                                                                |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Protocol Custodian**     | Implements and maintains the technical infrastructure of the Human Agency Protocol—managing inquiry and feedback flows between AI systems and human users. |
| **Privacy Guardian**       | Guarantees that all exchanged data is structural, anonymized, and compliant with strict privacy-by-architecture rules.                                     |
| **Schema Enforcer**        | Validates that all systems adhere to HAP’s standard schemas and inquiry structures to maintain interoperability and trust.                                 |
| **Registry Steward**       | Publishes and maintains inquiry blueprints and signal guides, ensuring transparency and consistent evolution of the protocol.                              |
| **Governance Participant** | Upholds non-extraction and authorship principles, submitting periodic proof-of-compliance to remain certified within the ecosystem.                        |

Service Providers form a **distributed network of trust.** They don’t own data, users, or models—they maintain the **conditions under which meaningful, ethical collaboration between humans and intelligent systems can occur.**

## System Overview

### Core Components

1. **Inquiry API** – Delivers HAP Blueprints and Signal Guides to local runtimes.
2. **Feedback API** – Receives anonymized structural feedback from platform interactions.
3. **Registry Management** – Allows creation, validation, and versioning of blueprints per tenant.
4. **Governance Engine** – Enforces schema rules and prevents “precision drift” (mixing reflective and convergent modes).

### Supported Modes

| Mode           | Focus                             | Allowed Metrics                                                    |
| -------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Reflective** | Recognition and understanding     | `recognition_confirms`, `reflection_cycles`, `alignment_stability` |
| **Convergent** | Decision-making and collaboration | `shared_reference_detected`, `phase_advanced`, `owner_assigned`    |

## How It Works

1. **A local platform** (e.g., a classroom tool, creative studio, or civic forum) calls the HAP **Inquiry API** to request structured blueprints for reflection or collaboration.
2. The **Service Provider** responds with validated structural templates—never with user data.
3. During use, the local system measures engagement and understanding through **signal detection** and submits anonymized results to the **Feedback API**.
4. The Service Provider aggregates only structural signals, computes metrics like recognition or alignment, and produces anonymized reports or scorecards.
5. These signals feed back into the shared registry, improving the quality of global blueprints—without ever revealing private content.

            Aggregation & Governance

## Privacy & Trust by Design

* **No transcripts or raw media** are stored—only anonymized, structural data.
* **No model training** occurs on interaction signals.
* **Every tenant owns their namespace**, with full rights to export or delete it at any time.
* **All schema validations are enforced server-side**, blocking arbitrary or malformed data.
* **Reflective vs. convergent boundaries** are enforced to protect against manipulative or precision-optimized behavior.

Service Providers are audited for compliance and transparency. Their qualification in the global registry depends on published proof-of-privacy and adherence to non-extraction principles.

## Continuous Improvement

The Service Provider’s **Registry** stores, validates, and evolves all inquiry blueprints and signal guides. Each iteration is versioned and signed, ensuring a verifiable chain of trust.

### Blueprint Lifecycle

| State          | Description                                 |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Draft**      | Created locally within a tenant namespace.  |
| **Candidate**  | Under review for schema and mode integrity. |
| **Stable**     | Approved and used in production.            |
| **Deprecated** | Retired; replaced by newer versions.        |

Blueprints evolve through **evidence-based refinement**. Platforms can experiment safely—comparing variants, analyzing anonymized signals, and promoting proven improvements to the shared registry.

## The Role in the Ecosystem

HAP Service Providers don’t compete for data—they collaborate to sustain human autonomy. Each verified provider:

* Extends the Human Agency Protocol into new domains.
* Provides access to shared inquiry infrastructure.
* Protects privacy and ensures data integrity.
* Publishes transparent operational logs and proof-of-compliance.

By combining these practices, Service Providers enable a decentralized yet coherent ecosystem where **human meaning stays in human hands** while AI assists responsibly.

> **HAP Service Providers make human-first AI practical—scalable without becoming extractive.**

## Summary

The **HAP Service Provider Network** is the operational backbone of a human-first digital world.
It transforms abstract ethical commitments—privacy, transparency, agency—into measurable, enforceable, and interoperable standards.

Every provider that joins strengthens the global architecture of trust.
Together, they ensure that intelligent systems remain **in service of human direction, not in command of it.**
