        <h2>Why We Built This</h2>
        <p class="lead">
            The age of intelligent automation creates a paradox: <strong>intelligence becomes abundant, but human agency becomes scarce</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            HAP exists to restore that balance by giving platforms the ability to run human-first AI interactions that protect autonomy, measure qualitative signals instead of efficiency-only metrics, and maintain privacy-by-design—avoiding data centralization or content sharing.

    <h2 id="why">The Automation-Agency Paradox</h2>
    <p>
        Frontier AI is optimized for <strong>automation</strong>: take a request, reason over it, and produce an answer—or let an agent execute it.
        That capability is extraordinary, but it has a ceiling. As more work becomes automatable, the <strong>marginal value of execution drops toward zero</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        What doesn't drop is the value of <strong>human agency</strong>—the capacity of individuals and groups to choose, to set purpose, to act from their own context.
        In a world where everything can be done, the scarce thing becomes: <strong>knowing what's worth doing, why it matters—and turning that knowing into action that carries human value</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>What HAP Provides</h2>
    <p>
        The Human Agency Protocol is infrastructure for that world. It is a <strong>global inquiry protocol</strong> that AI-native, privacy-first systems can call to strengthen human and collective agency—without ever sharing user content.
    </p>
    <p>
        It doesn't produce answers or actions. It improves the <em>quality, timing, and structure of questions</em> that local systems ask—so humans remain in authorship of meaning and direction.
    </p>

    <h2 id="adopters">First Adopters</h2>
    <p>Two first adopters serve as reference cases:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Nearmydear</strong> – collective clarity and shared action in groups</li>
        <li><strong>The Resonance Room</strong> – individual creative development and reflection</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Both rely on the same foundation: an external, neutral layer that provides <strong>Inquiry Blueprints</strong> instead of predefined prompts, allowing each to adapt questions locally while keeping private context sealed.
    </p>

    <h2>Core Principles</h2>

    <h3>1. Privacy-by-Architecture</h3>
    <p>
        No raw text, transcripts, or media are ever stored. All data is <strong>structural</strong>, aggregated, and anonymized.
        The Protocol is designed with fixed schemas that prevent content leakage—measuring <em>recognition</em> and <em>alignment</em> without storing personal context.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Inquiry Over Answers</h3>
    <p>
        HAP shifts focus from automation (producing answers) to <strong>strengthening human choice</strong> through better questions.
        The Inquiry Ladder—Meaning → Purpose → Intention → Action—provides a structural model that guides systems to ask the right questions at the right time.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Open Governance</h3>
    <p>
        HAP is maintained by stewards, not owners. Blueprints and signal guides are versioned, reviewed, and published through a transparent governance process.
        The protocol supports federation—regional nodes can enforce standards while maintaining local sovereignty.
    </p>
